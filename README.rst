Official tutorial from the flask site


Taken from http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/tutorial/#tutorial
Also based on http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/#quickstart
Pretty crappy tutorial combining all config and code in one file
Uses sqlite
Does not use sqlalchemy


In order to create the database
 - on command shell inside the flaskr dir>> python
 - inside python shell >> from flaskr import init\_db
 - inside python shell >> init\_db

To run the server
- on command shell >> python flaskr.py
